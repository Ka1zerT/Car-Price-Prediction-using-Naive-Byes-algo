# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Naive-Byes-algo
Hello evevryone, I have made this Car Price Prediction system including Naive Bayes Algorithm which gives you the Price of the car based on the model, how much KM driven, Fuel type and year of purchase of car.
I have made this data analysis project so you have to install following Libraries (Flask, Pickle, Pandas, Numpy and matplotlib) to make the project work, you can install the libraries using pip install command

I have also made naive bayes variation file for the project
I have used Quickr data set for the cars and cleansed them using ETL tools and made new csv file Cleaned car dataset
I also made a simple static website using html and css so that user can select their choices and get thier car price result
